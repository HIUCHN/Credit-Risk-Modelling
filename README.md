## Credit-Risk-Modelling
Credit risk modeling is important for financial institutions. It represents the risk of a borrower not being able to pay back the loan amount, credit card or other types of loans. In some cases, borrowers can pay partial of the debt amount; therefore, the principal amount and interest amount are not paid. Both statistics and machine learning techniques play an important role in credit risk modeling. Some core skills include handling big data and advanced statistical modeling.

### Dataset

The dataset contains more than 800,000 consumer loans issued from 2007 to 2015 by Lending Club. It is a large US peer-to-peer lending company. There are different versions of this dataset online and we take a version available on kaggle.com on (link)[https://www.kaggle.com/wendykan/lending-club-loan-data/version/1} . It should be noted that are discrete and continous columns that should be preprocessed accordingly.

### Target 🎯

One of the prominent bank is asked us to build a credit risk model by using Loan Data to provide them a scorecard to use in their daily procedures.

In Notebook Part 1 
- Preprocessing - Converting columns into dummy variables by fine and coarse classing

In Notebook Part 2
- Calculate the PD model with logistic regression
- Based on PD model, provide a practical scorecard in csv format
